# MongoDB $inc Operator Type Error

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update operations. The `$inc` operator is used to increment or decrement a numerical field.  However, providing a non-numeric value as the increment leads to an error or unexpected behavior. 

The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect usage, while `bugSolution.js` provides the correct implementation.
